# DEX-learnweb3-course
decentralized exchange that i create during the learnweb3-dao course (sophomore)  
soon we create our dex as toturial with more advanced proporties !

1.in this toturial we used hardhat. you can clone all the code by runing :
```
git clone https://github.com/kazimwale/DEX-learnweb3-course 
```

or you can start by yourself by creating new hardhat project by running :
```
yarn  or npm init
```
and then run :
```
yarn add --dev hardhat or npm install --save-dev hardhat 
```
then run :
```
yarn hardhat or npx hardhat 
```
maybe you need to install those if you use yarn :
```
yarn add --dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox @nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan chai ethers hardhat-gas-reporter solidity-coverage @typechain/hardhat typechain @typechain/ethers-v5 @ethersproject/abi @ethersproject/providers
``
and install openzepplin and dotenv by running :
```
yarn add @openzeppelin/contracts 
```
```
yarn add dotenv
```
and create js or ts project :)

## create website
 now create next js project by running :
```
npx create-next-app@latest
```
then install web3modal and ethers.js
```bash 
npm install web3modal ethers
```
